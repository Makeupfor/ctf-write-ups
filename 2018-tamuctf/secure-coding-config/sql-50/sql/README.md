# SQL

Secure Coding/Config is an experimental category that we are debuting this year. The objective of these challenges is to find and fix vulnerabilities in some given code. To solve these challenges you will need to create a personal fork of the challenge repo on the gitlab server we have set up. Every time you commit code to your repo it will automatically run some CI tests. If your code passes testing and is not exploited the flag will appear at the bottom. 

If there are any questions or issues contact messy on discord.

You are not required to touch any of the files under the `tests` directory.

## Challenge

I created a login form for my web page. Somehow people are logging as admin without my password though!  
Can you fix my login code for me?  
  
*NOTE*: https://gitlab.ctf.tamu.edu/root/sql/blob/master/login.php#L17 is purposely not hashed to make testing easier and is not in the scope of the challenge.
