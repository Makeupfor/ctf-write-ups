# nginx
Secure Coding/Config is an experimental category that we are debuting this year. The objective of these challenges is to find and fix vulnerabilities in some given code. To solve these challenges you will need to create a personal fork of the challenge repo on the gitlab server we have set up. Every time you commit code to your repo it will automatically run some CI tests. If your code passes testing and is not exploited the flag will appear at the bottom. 

If there are any questions or issues contact messy on discord.

You are not required to touch any of the files under the `tests` directory.

## Challenge:
My friend set up a web server using nginx but he keeps complaining that people are finding files that they are not supposed to be able to get to. Can you fix his configuration file for him?  
  
The config he is using is `default`
