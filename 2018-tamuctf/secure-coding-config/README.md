## Secure Coding/Config

> Secure Coding/Config is an experimental category that we are debuting this year. The objective of these challenges is to find and fix vulnerabilities in some given code. To solve these challenges you will need to create a personal fork of the challenge repo on the gitlab server we have set up. Every time you commit code to your repo it will automatically run some CI tests. To view the results of the CI test click on the CI/CD tab->Jobs->Status of the latest test. If your code passes testing and is not exploited the flag will appear at the bottom.
