# Maze

Secure Coding/Config is an experimental category that we are debuting this year. The objective of these challenges is to find and fix vulnerabilities in some given code. To solve these challenges you will need to create a personal fork of the challenge repo on the gitlab server we have set up. Every time you commit code to your repo it will automatically run some CI tests. If your code passes testing and is not exploited the flag will appear at the bottom. 

If there are any questions or issues contact messy on discord.

You are not required to touch any of the files under the `tests` directory.

## Challenge
I created this really cool CTF challenge where users are supposed to bypass client side authentication to get a flag. However it seems like people are able get the flag through other means!  
Can you find and fix the problem in my challenge for me?
