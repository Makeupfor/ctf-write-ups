# Insecure Shell Plugin

Secure Coding/Config is an experimental category that we are debuting this year. The objective of these challenges is to find and fix vulnerabilities in some given code. To solve these challenges you will need to create a personal fork of the challenge repo on the gitlab server we have set up. Every time you commit code to your repo it will automatically run some CI tests. If your code passes testing and is not exploited the flag will appear at the bottom. 

If there are any questions or issues contact messy on discord.

You are not required to touch any of the files under the `tests` directory.


## Challenge

I'm running a CTF competition that is geared towards newer students. I know that most of the students don't have easy access to a linux machine so why not give students shell access to my server so that they can use it to solve challenges?  
  
In order to make this a reality I wrote this cool plugin for CTFd to automatically create an account when they register for the competition.  
One of the students claims that they can get a root shell on my server though. Can you figure out what happened and fix the issue for me?
